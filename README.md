# ng2-webcam-Typescript
* ng2-webcam-Typescript package is a webcam package used in angular2 project for taking a picture and drawing it on a canvas.<br/>
* This package supports typescript syntax, but needs to be modified in future to give full support for typescript<br/>
* Instead of specifying templateUrl, the webcam template code is directly written in the webcam.component.ts file. Hence the webcam.html file is not used here.
